  - Hiya buddy!
  - "Good news and bad news. Good news first: the princess has defeated the false
    king and Hyrule has been saved. We might have some rebuilding to do and there
    will be difficult times ahead, but I believe it is thanks to you and your efforts
    that we managed to win. But\u2026 as for the bad news: I\u2019m afraid the hero
    was felled in battle. Do not beat yourself up over it. Sometimes selling the
    right items is all about the timing and chance."
  - I will be home soon.
