  - Hi kid!
  - "I\u2019m so grateful you agreed to take care of the shop while I go out on my
    annual Beetle-hunting trip. Wish me luck!"
  - "Remember, that as a shopkeeper you have many responsibilities, the most obvious
    of which is to make money, but it is equally important to remember to sell your
    customers the items that will help them the most\u2026 or even if not them, the
    world itself."
  - Good luck!
