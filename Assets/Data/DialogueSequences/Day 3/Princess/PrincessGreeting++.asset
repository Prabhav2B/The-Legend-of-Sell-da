  - 'Good day! '
  - Oh, I want to thank you once more, not only for yesterday, but the day before.
    Thanks to the items you have sold me, I have been able to fight for Hyrule in
    a way I otherwise might not have, so I and Hyrule thank you.
  - 'Today will be the deciding battle, so I truly hope you have something good for
    me today? '
